## Quick instructions

- Newsboat operates using a `urls` file where each line is
    for a specific rss feed.
- Newsboat has the hability to use "tags" at the end of
    urls.
- Weird names in the feed can be corrected at the end of urls
    using "~Better Name".
- You can create and modify keybindings using the `config`
    file.
